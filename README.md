# seka.ing

The source code of https://seka.ing - a Project Sekai leaderboard tracker site.

## Features

### Leaderboard tracker

Mirrors the in-game leaderboard in realtime, and includes helpful info such as live countdown, past hour score delta, and average score gain.

For cheerful carnival events, both teams' special matches sum, as well as midterm results are displayed. Additionally, in-game special match/win streak announcements are mirrored and displayed at the top.

For worldlink events, all chapters' leaderboards, as well as the current chapter's character indicator are displayed.

Clicking on a player's leaderboard entry enables tracking mode, which highlights the selected player and auto scrolls to their position on the leaderboard.

### Event player stats

Displays detailed info about the player's progress, including:
- Points breakdown of the past hour's games
- Heatmap of games played per hour
- Graph of the player's score over time

### Image generator

Uses the game's latest assets to automatically generate certain images as they appear in game, including:
- Leader cards (displayed on the leaderboard)
- Deck cards (displayed in event profiles)
- Event titles (displayed on https://seka.ing/titles)

Source code is located in a separate repository: https://github.com/aamiaa/sekai-images

### Automated data updating

The latest game data and assets are downloaded automatically, allowing the site to continue running unattended.
